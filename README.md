## 1. Packages used:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
# 2. Business Values:

Following are the questions I have answered doing my work:

1. Highest price of listing?
2. Average monthly charged price? 
3. Host respond time taken?
4. Popular neighborhoods area and Most expensive\cheapest neighborhoods in Seattle?
5. Effect of reviewer ratings?
6. Does certain facilities impact on price?
## 3. Summary of the Results:
The data analysis and results are included in the Jupyter notebook.
Some findings on the business questions below :<br>
  * Highest price is recorded in June (Summer vacation time) and December (Christmas vacation time) which reflects that vacation time is busiest time that tend to rise price.
  * In Q1 2016, price charged was lower than the average for the whole year due to low demand time.
  * Approx. half of hosts respond within an hour and impact is discussed in last task.
  * 20% of the properties are located in Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford.
  * Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay and Westlake are expensive areas.
  * Rainier Beach, Olympic Hills and South Delridge are cheaper areas.
  * Cleanliness is very important for good rating because Matrix plot represents that Cleanliness has the highest correlation with over all other ratings. Good communication with the customer is highly correlated with the check in rating. 
  * Ratings have little impact on the price charged by the host. Location has a low positive correlation with price.
  * Beds, bedrooms and bathrooms have positive affect on price but minimum and maximum nights are not showing any impact on pricing.
